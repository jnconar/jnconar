### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love sports and outdoor activities to include hiking and mountain biking. 

I am originally from Phoenix, AZ and currently live outside of Denver, CO. 

I love the Phoenix Suns, Denver Nuggets, Arizona Cardinals, Denver Broncos, and the Colorado Rockies. 

I am interested in data visualization, machine learning, data analytics, and data mining. 

I am currently a student at Syracuse University in the MS Applied Data Science Program.
